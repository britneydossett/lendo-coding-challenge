# Notes:

- For the cart, if I had more time, I would consider updating the quantity for each item, as opposed to just adding each item to the array. With this, you would have to consider the computational time for each method, and see what works best for the amount of products you have. If it's common for someone to but 1000 of one item in a cart, then you would want to consider updating quantity. If people generally buy 1-2 items, then the array method will probably be faster.
